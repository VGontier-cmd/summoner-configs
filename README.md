## **Description**
This application enables League of Legends players to manage the configurations of different League accounts and switch between them easily. It is built using an Electron, Vite, React, and Sass boilerplate, all in Typescript.

## **Features**
- Manage your different accounts configurations
- Import and export them easily


## **How to use**
1Ô∏è‚É£ - Launch the League of Legends client and Summoner's Configs application.

2Ô∏è‚É£ - Configure your Lol configuration path in the application using the "gear" button. 

3Ô∏è‚É£ - Import your account configurations by clicking on the import button in our application and choosing a profile name.

4Ô∏è‚É£ - Repeat the import for each of your league accounts.

5Ô∏è‚É£ - Now that you have all your configurations, you can easily switch from one to another by exporting them.

**Please note that each time you import a profile into the League Client, you need to start a game to take it into account (this can be a custom game or anything else).
